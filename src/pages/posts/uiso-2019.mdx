_“Given a lever long enough and a pivot on which to place it, one could shift the world”_
is a famous saying by an antique mathematician Archimedes. The primary definition of a
lever is that for the effort needed to be exerted to decrease, the length of the lever
should be increased. One can also apply this law to life. Experiences and opportunities
build up the life’s levers which together motivate a person to succeed. However, a lever
becomes obsolete when forced upon an inaccurately placed pivot. Succeeding to fulfill
oneself with passion and ideals is to build and place a solid pivot. Otherwise, these
opportunities and experiences are to become useless. Majority fail to meet the balance
between these two variables and thus all their efforts to achieve their full capacity
are in vain. I, on the other hand, strive to be someone to find that balance.

In an attempt to set up a such a successful lever in my life,
I have searched for these opportunities ever since I know myself. I have always been
marked by my heightened curiosity and passions for learning. As an expected consequence
of such my character, I became a member of the student organization in my freshman year
at university. Half way through my first semester in that organization, one of my
teammates came up to me and asked why did I choose to take part in such sort of
leadership activities. Although I did have an answer for her to be pleased, what struck
me was that I could not define what leadership meant to me. After this, I began to think of an answer.

Looking up leadership in the dictionary, I found out that it was
the skill to lead and the act of leading. However, these two definitions of leadership
seemed too broad to me. Everyone has their own understanding or perception of what it
actually means. At first, when I was challenged to illustrate leadership by comparing it to
usual things, I believed it was a boring and complicated task. However as I began to come up
with actual answers, I realized that leadership could be compared to almost everything a
person is surrounded by.

Everything about leadership I learned from a computer. Everything
about leadership I learned from a ball. A computer can add any numbers together to construct
the best outcome. It can hide what is irrelevant and only show what is important. It can
deal with many types of problems. Similarly, a ball is able to bounce back when thrown.
It is spherical and has no creases. It can be thrown back and forth in a game by various
people. These are all important qualities for a leader to possess. A leader should be able
to accumulate many ideas together to come up with the best possible plan. A leader should
accept and be ready to look at every possible situation thrown at him. He should never
dwell on the past and should be able to bounce back from any obstacles faced.

This made me realize that being a leader is so much more than just
having authority and having the ability to take control of a situation. A leader has to be
trusting of all the people he leads and, leaders must be able to combine ideas into one
encompassing idea. They cannot sit in the background and watch events happen; they have to
jump in and be involved. They should not delegate all their responsibilities away. A leader
has to believe in people. And that should drive his action and ambitions, and define him in
a world of cynicism and doubt. Leadership is so much more than what the dictionary says it is.

Finally, I came to realize that I have many of these qualities. I have
the ability to solve variety of problems, lead through adversity, and be versatile. From
answering this question, I realized that I could lead effectively, even if my leadership style
might be different from others.

The building of such a successful lever has only just begun for me.
There is still so much that I have not seen or done. Life is full of opportunities. That’s why
I want to be trusted by people and that’s why I want to become a deserved _President of UISO_.
